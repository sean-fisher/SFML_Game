# SFML_Game
This is the repository for a personal game development project I've been working on since Fall 2016. After moving away from Unity, I began development on a custom game engine using C++ and OpenGL/SFML in November 2017. I haven't included everything I've made for privacy reasons, but a lot of the programming and art I have included in this repo.

It is a 2D Role-playing game inspired by the likes of Chrono Trigger, Mother 3, and Final Fantasy VI. One of the goals I settled on when first starting this project was to complete it with as high a level of quality as possible. As such, it likely won't be finished for some time. I am hoping it can be finished in 2020, but that is a very rough estimate.
